They benefit users with hearing impairments, non-native speakers, and those in noisy environments.

WebVTT is a simple, plain-text format that includes timecodes to synchronize text with media playback.

8. JavaScript Interaction:

You can use JavaScript to manipulate text tracks dynamically, change language options, or toggle subtitles on/off based on user preferences.
9. Testing and Validation:

Ensure that your text tracks are synchronized correctly with media playback.
Validate your WebVTT files to avoid syntax errors.
10. Compatibility:
- Check browser support for the <track> element and WebVTT format to ensure a consistent experience across different platforms.

11. Video SEO:
- Search engines may use text tracks for indexing multimedia content, so it's important to provide accurate captions and metadata.

12. Legal Requirements:
- Depending on your region and content type, there may be legal requirements for providing accessibility features like captions.

13. User Experience:
